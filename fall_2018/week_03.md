## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

I didn't get a chance to work on anything this week because I am still fairly clueless as to what I need to do
and what I need to accomplish. However, the plan remains that I work on learning reactJS.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

The plan remains that I work on learning reactJS and git.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

I am very new to all this stuff and the lack of communication and guidance is hurting me. I feel like the people
who are already proficient at git and coding are moving extremely fast and I am just being left behind. I would love to
spend more time on this but the combination of schoolwork and other clubs makes it difficult.
