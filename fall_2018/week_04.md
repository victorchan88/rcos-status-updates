I hope to clear up all my questions and get true guidance as to what exactly I am supposed to do in the

I am very new to all this stuff and the lack of communication and guidance is hurting me. I feel like the people
who are already proficient at git and coding are moving extremely fast and I am just being left behind. I would love to
spend more time on this but the combination of schoolwork and other clubs makes it difficult.
