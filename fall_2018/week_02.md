For the week of October 1, 2018, I was put on the curriculum subteam for the Open Source Curriculum Project and I will be
watching videos on how to use reactJS.

## This Week's Plan

For the upcoming week of October 8, 2018, I plan on finalizing all the tutorial work and to hopefully start making meaningful
commits and contributions to the project.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I am very new to all this stuff and I am not sure if I will be able to truly become decent at reactJS in 1 week.
